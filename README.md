# NameNormaliserDiscord

Ever been using Discord and found that you can't read someone's name because their role colour is too dark or light? (especially light theme users whose friends all hate light theme and give them a light role colour)

Name normaliser fixes this. For BetterDiscord users, just download the corresponding version:
- Dark version is for users of dark themes and makes all names white
- Light version is for users of light themes and makes all names black

For powercord users, you stuff is in the subdirectory.
